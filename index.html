<h1>The basic of Web & HTML</h1>
<b>Main Terminology</b>
<br>1- HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
<br>2- WWW - World wide web
<br>3- How the web (Internet) works: The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. 
<br> When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
<br> Why Computers are Stupid: Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

<p><b>Key Points of HTML</b>

</p>1- HTML - main type of doc on the web
<br>2- Pain text, HTML, Images, Videos and Music - all these types of files can be found on web.
<br>3-HTML is made up of;
<br>a- Text Content - what you see
<br>b-Markup - what it looks like ref to other documents (example images & videos)
<br>c- Links to other pages.
<br>4- HTML documents are made of HTML Tags and Elements. 
<br>When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. This video explains the distinction well.
<br>5- HTML elements are either inline or block. 
<br>Examples of Inline elements are; (all in angle brackets) a, br, span, img, strong, em.
<br>Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
<br>Examples of block elements are; (all in angle brackets) div, p, form.
<br>6- Attributes: This is a property of an HTML element. For example; to set the "href" attribute of anchor tag to the URL.
<br>Void Tag: Doesn't require a closing tag For example; "br" tag.
